# Generative IR Survey Paper Structure

## Introduction
Introduce the emerging field of Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR), highlighting its importance and the innovation of Differentiable Search Indexes (DSI) in transforming traditional IR systems. This section sets the stage for the paper by outlining the motivation and the overarching goal of the survey.

## Generative IR Defined through the Concept of DSI
### Brief Introduction to Differentiable Search Index (DSI)
- **Indexing and Retrieval Components**: Define DSI and explain its two major components, indexing and retrieval, as the backbone of Generative IR. Emphasize how DSI integrates these components into a unified, gradient-based optimization framework.
- **Key Advancements**: Highlight how DSI enables more flexible and powerful search capabilities by allowing the system to learn and adapt from data directly.

### Distinguishing DSI from Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)
- **Generative vs. Dense Retrieval**: Contrast DSI's generative capabilities with DPR's vector space matching approach, underscoring DSI's potential for generating more nuanced and context-aware responses.

## Identifier Strategies in Generative IR
### Document Identifiers
- **Evolution of Document IDs in DSI**: Discuss advancements in using Transformer architectures and learning strategies to efficiently index and retrieve documents with dynamic updates and tokenization techniques.

### String Identifiers
- **Innovations in String-based Retrieval**: Explore how generative models create and utilize string identifiers, enhancing semantic understanding and ranking within Generative IR systems.

## Enhancing Query Generation and Expansion
Discuss the role of query generation and expansion in improving IR performance, including generating training data and enhancing query-document matching through generative techniques.

## Document Representation in DSI
- **DSI Approaches**: Cover various strategies for document representation within DSI, including direct, set, and inverted indexing.
- **Bridging Indexing and Retrieval**: Analyze how DSI addresses the challenge of seamlessly connecting query representation with document indexing for more effective retrieval.

## Evaluation of Generative IR
Compare the performance of traditional IR systems with DSI-based IR systems, highlighting the improvements in accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- **Challenges with DSI**: Address potential issues, such as generating non-existent document IDs and scaling DSI systems to handle large data volumes.
- **Closing the Gap**: Discuss ongoing research and potential solutions to bridge the remaining gaps between indexing and retrieval in Generative IR systems.

This structure aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Generative IR and the pivotal role of Differentiable Search Indexes, making it accessible to newcomers while detailing the progress and challenges in the field.
