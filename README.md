# Generative IR Survey Paper Structure

## Introduction
Introduce the emerging field of Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR), highlighting its importance and the innovation of Differentiable Search Indexes (DSI) in transforming traditional IR systems. This section sets the stage for the paper by outlining the motivation and the overarching goal of the survey.

## Definition of GenIR (DSI)
### Intro to DSI
Two Major Components
- Indexing
- Retrieval

### Distinguishing DSI from Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)

## Identifier Strategies in Generative IR
### Document Identifiers

- Transformer Memory as a Differentiable Search Index
- DSI++: Updating Transformer Memory with New Documents
- Learning to Tokenize for Generative Retrieval

### String Identifiers

- Autoregressive Search Engines: Generating Substrings as Document Identifiers
- Semantic-Enhanced Differentiable Search Index Inspired by Learning Strategies
- Learning to Rank in Generative Retrieval
- TOME: A Two-stage Approach for Model-based Retrieval
- Multiview Identifiers Enhanced Generative Retrieval

## Enhancing Query Generation and Expansion
- generating more training data
- document representation as queries

## Document Representation in DSI
- DSI
    - Direct Indexing
    - Set Indexing
    - Inverted Index
- Bridging the Gap
    - queries as representation
    - Bridging the Gap Between Indexing and Retrieval for Differentiable Search Index with Query Generation
    - Multiview Identifiers Enhanced Generative Retrieval

## Evaluation of Generative IR
Compare the performance of traditional IR systems with DSI-based IR systems

## Limitations and Future Directions
- **Challenges with DSI**: Address potential issues
  - generating non-existent document IDs (FM Index)
  - scaling DSI systems to handle large data volumes.

This structure aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Generative IR and the pivotal role of Differentiable Search Indexes, making it accessible to newcomers while detailing the progress and challenges in the field.
